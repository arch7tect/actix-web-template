# Deployment Instructions:
#
# This is a template deployment workflow. To use it:
#
# 1. Configure GitHub Environments:
#    - Go to Settings > Environments
#    - Create 'staging' and 'production' environments
#    - Add protection rules for production (require approvals)
#    - Add environment secrets (SSH keys, API tokens, etc.)
#
# 2. Choose a deployment strategy:
#    - Docker: Pull and run the image from GHCR
#    - Kubernetes: kubectl apply -f k8s/
#    - Cloud Platform: Use platform-specific actions
#      - AWS: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials
#      - Azure: azure/login
#      - GCP: google-github-actions/auth
#
# 3. Add deployment scripts:
#    - Create deployment scripts in a 'scripts/' directory
#    - Or use existing tools like Terraform, Ansible, Helm
#
# 4. Configure secrets:
#    - DEPLOY_SSH_KEY (for SSH deployments)
#    - KUBECONFIG (for Kubernetes)
#    - Cloud provider credentials
#
# 5. Set up monitoring and notifications:
#    - Slack webhook: SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
#    - Email notifications
#    - PagerDuty, Datadog, etc.
#
# Example Docker deployment to a server:
#
# - name: Deploy via SSH
#   uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
#   with:
#     host: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOST }}
#     username: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}
#     key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_SSH_KEY }}
#     script: |
#       docker pull ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.ref_name }}
#       docker-compose down
#       docker-compose up -d
#
# Example Kubernetes deployment:
#
# - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
#   uses: azure/k8s-deploy@v4
#   with:
#     manifests: |
#       k8s/deployment.yml
#       k8s/service.yml
#     images: |
#       ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.ref_name }}
